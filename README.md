Hi! I’m Rakshana, a B.E. ECE student who loves mixing creativity with technology. Along with engineering, I’m passionate about designing, fashion, and movies, which inspire my ideas and style. I’m a hardworking, creative person who enjoys learning and exploring new things. My goal is to build a future where I combine my technical skills with creative work — especially in UI/UX or visual design. Thanks for visiting my GitHub space!
